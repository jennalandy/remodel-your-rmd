# Remodel Your Rmd - Source Code

Through my experiences in industry and research, I’ve learned that a lot of cool things can be done with R and RStudio. Even though they often intimidated me at first, they always ended up being intuitive, well documented, and very useful to my R workflow. In this tutorial I’ll go through how I’ve “remodeled my Rmd”--and how you can do the same--by developing simple R packages for research projects, parameterizing R Markdowns for modular reports, making pretty R Markdowns, and publishing to R Markdown websites and Shiny Apps.

Topics Covered:

- R Package Development
- Parameterized Rmd Reports
- Rmd Customizations
    - Themes and Formats
    - Tabs
    - Kable Tables
    - Interactive Plots Directly from `ggplot2`
- Publishing R Markdown Websites with Github Pages
